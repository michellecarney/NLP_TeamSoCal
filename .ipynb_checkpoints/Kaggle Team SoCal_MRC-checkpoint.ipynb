Shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like.

I asked if they though she needed to come back to the office.  The dr told me that it sounded like she was overheated and to put cold towels on her.  I told him that I didn't think that was the problem because she hadn't been out.  At this point they were open and would be for another hour.   Two hours later I was at a vet hospital with them telling me she is suffering from a heart problem and that they really couldn't do anything for her.  WHAT?!?!  So I found myself having to put her down.  Fast forward to now.  I have a 14 wk puppy that has blood in its stool. They have not seen her yet. I bring in a sample.  Wait 24 hrs.  They leave a message that it's positive and to call for an appt.  I call. She has to wait 4 days to be seen.  WHAT?!?!?   Obviously my pups are out of there for good!

       " \"11|4|Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!\",\n",
       " '12|4|\"New to area and decided to pay this shop a visit! It was definitely the best experience I\\'ve ever had with a tailor. He is MUCH cheaper than the other shops, he charges 10 while others charge $15, and he goes above and beyond for what he charges.',\n",

When I went to pick it up it was not even ready then to find out the next day that I was being charged $60. My family and I have been coming here for a few years and never ever spent anything even remotely close to $60 worth on alterations. My mom came down to pick up two things right before and and her total was $25... Not only are the prices extremely inconsistent when I finally got the dress the neck was still way too loose and the zipper didn\\'t go up all the way I had to pin the dress myself and wear it with safety pins to a wedding. I was not able to get my money back because apparently \"\"it wasn\\'t his fault\"\" and he told me not to worry about it. This is probably the worst business in Carnegie. ',\n",

I think possibly a little too young and hip. My dentist knew what she was doing but I didn't adore her. I'm still working out my bill because they charged me too much on my copay and don't really seem to have all their info. together. After a cleaning and fillings, I think I'm going to look for somewhere else to get my future dental work done...\",\n",

       " '31|3|\"THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn\\'t know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \"\"dentist\"\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \"\"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\"\". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn\\'t feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \"\"bone graft\"\". So, I signed everything. I wasn\\'t even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \"\"dentist\"\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I\\'m assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn\\'t sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don\\'t expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.\"',\n",
